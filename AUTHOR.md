# Practice

I view myself as a craftsman software engineer, in a term which I heard from one of my colleagues, a humble 
engineer.  I strive to understand and remember that I and everyone needs to develop a set of good habits so that the team
can be successful.

The focus that I have for work is not great projects and the large technology achievements, but to be able to 
deliver the goals we need to fulfil the needs of our customers in a way which is scalable and maintainable.

I believe this can be done through processes and habits.  I work to deliver small code pushes, processing a set of 
verifications through automated processes.

# History

Much of my experience is with smaller or med sized companies, organizations in which people needed to do different 
jobs and to rely upon themselves to find the correct solution always with limited resources.

It has amazes me to see how technology have changed and how much is in reach of so many people.  With almost unlimited 
access to tools and information, it is an awesome time to work in technology.

A lot of my history has not been with web technology but with working with C/C++ on client/server applications.

# Improvement

I try to keep up to date with this website, as well as varies online training website such as Pluralsight, Udemy, 
YouTube.  I enjoy reading and intersperse a technical book in my reading stream.  Furthermore, I use blogs to keep
up with what is happening in our ever-changing field.

# Interests

My current focus is NodeJS and React so that I can host my resume in a way that is fun to me and that I can improve
my general web skills.  I will be extending this site to use a kotlin API server instead of the NodeJS API server.  And
want to add a simple list functionality so that my family to communicate with me in a to-do list.  I want to make
this list accessible on mobile devices, but have not decided if I want to create a full app or to extend RWD outside a 
browser.

# Personal

I like to keep my life fairly simple and entertaining myself with simple things.  Which I like to enjoy with my 
family.  We like to hike, travel, and cook.  But probably most of all we enjoy skiing.  We have a son, which is 
growing very fast, and we already him leaving to go away to school.
