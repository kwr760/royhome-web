# Practice

I view myself as a craftsman software engineer.  From a term which I heard from one of my colleagues, a humble
engineer.  I strive to understand and remember that I and everyone needs to develop a set of good habits so that 
the team can be successful.  Communication, practice, and continual learning.

The focus that I have for work is not great projects and the large technology achievements, but to be able to 
deliver the goals we need to fulfil the needs of our customers in a way which is scalable and maintainable.

I believe this can be done through habit and following processes.  I work to deliver in small code pushes, 
processing a set of verifications through automated processes.

# History

Much of my experience is with small or medium sized companies, organizations in which people needed to do different 
jobs and to rely upon themselves to find the correct solution always with limited resources.

It amazes me to see how technology have changed and how much is in reach of so many people.  With almost unlimited 
access to tools and information, it is an awesome time to work in technology.

A lot of my history has not been with web technology but with working with C/C++ on client/server applications.
I transitioned to working on website on my last job, it is different then on my experience.  It is funny because
there are great difference in my current position and my previous.  Truth be told this has always been the case.

# Improvement

To improve, I read and practice.  I read books and web, about the technology I am interested and areas that I am
weak in.  And to be said with more confidence, areas that I am not as strong as I am with technology.

I practice and learn with this website.  As well as varies online training website such as Pluralsight, Udemy, 
or YouTube, usually when I am applying new technology to my site.

# Interests

My current focus is React anf Kotlin so that I can host my resume in a way that is fun to me and that I can improve
my skills.  I want to add a simple list functionality so that my family to communicate with me in a to-do list.  I 
want to make this list accessible on mobile devices, but have not decided if I want to create a full app or to 
extend RWD outside a browser.

# Personal

I like to keep my life fairly simple and entertaining myself with simple things.  Which I like to enjoy with my 
family.  We like to hike, travel, and cook.  But probably most of all we enjoy skiing.  We have a son, which is 
growing very fast, and we already miss him even he hasn't left for school.
